### Installation Package Consistency Check

- Step1: Generate the MD5 value for the downloaded installation package  

```sh
md5sm "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME"
```

```sh
cat "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5_NAME"

After configuring an EIP for a resource, it gains direct access to the Internet. If a resource is configured only with a private IP, it cannot access the Internet directly. In another cloud platforms, it may be referred to by a different names, such as 'Public IP address' in Azure.

```sh
bash /mnt/installer/install.sh
