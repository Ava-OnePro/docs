## VMware Environemnt Preparation

1. Export host information via vCenterï¼š[VMware Quick Investigation](../presales/hyperbdr-vmware-investigation.md)
2. Fill in detail VM host information based on the export inf, which will be used for DR setup . 

## VMware User Permission Requirements

### Why we need this permissions?

HyperBDR utilizes VMware CBT technology for incremental data synchronization. Change Block Tracking (CBT) is a technique employed in VMware for incremental backup and replication. It tracks the blocks that have changed on a virtual disk, allowing for the transmission of only the data associated with these changes during the backup and replication processes.

### VMware User Permission

Prepare the VMware user authentication information for data synchronization and ensure that the user has the necessary permissions.

Provide VMware user with following permissions:

| Permission Type       | Permissions                                        |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
